# Customer Segmentation for the Just Good Work App

##  Project Overview
This project analyses user data from the Just Good Work app (used by over 75,000 users) to identify customer segments and generate actionable insights.  
The goal is to support stakeholder decision-making, improve marketing strategies, and help prevent worker exploitation.

##  Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (Google Cloud SQL)
- Power BI
- Machine Learning: K-Modes, K-Means, DBSCAN
- PCA for dimensionality reduction

## Workflow
- Data collection and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and scaling
- Clustering with K-Modes, K-Means, and DBSCAN
- Model evaluation using Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index
- Building a Power BI dashboard for business insights

## Key Findings
- Central Asian users (ages 21â€“30) dominate app usage, mainly in agriculture and factory work.
- Seasonal trends observed: peaks in app registration during spring and mid-year.
- Recommendations developed for region-specific marketing and targeted user engagement strategies.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning for segmentation (unsupervised learning)
- Power BI dashboard creation
- SQL querying and cloud data handling
- Business problem solving and stakeholder reporting
