About Me

Hi, I’m Khanh Nguyen! I’m a Data Analyst with a background in Banking & Finance, currently completing my MSc in Business Analytics at Aston University (UK). My journey blends financial reasoning with strong technical skills in Python, SQL, and Power BI — and a passion for using data to solve real-world problems.

During my academic and industry projects, I’ve worked with large datasets, performed exploratory data analysis, built dashboards for stakeholders, and developed machine learning models to uncover patterns and drive decisions. I’m especially interested in applying analytics in areas like public impact, operational efficiency, and social good.

In my free time, I love exploring new tools, improving my analytics workflow, and continuously learning from real data challenges. Whether it’s transforming raw data or delivering actionable insights, I’m driven by curiosity and a strong sense of purpose.

This repository is where I showcase my projects, technical growth, and passion for all things data.
