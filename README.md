# About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Khanh Nguyen! Iâ€™m a Data Analyst with a MSc in Business Analytics. My journey blends financial reasoning with strong technical skills in Python, SQL, and Power BI â€” and a passion for using data to solve real-world problems.

During my academic and industry projects, Iâ€™ve worked with large datasets, performed exploratory data analysis, built dashboards for stakeholders, and developed machine learning models to uncover patterns and drive decisions. Iâ€™m especially interested in applying analytics in areas like public impact, operational efficiency, and social good.

In my free time, I love exploring new tools, improving my analytics workflow, and continuously learning from real data challenges. Whether itâ€™s transforming raw data or delivering actionable insights, Iâ€™m driven by curiosity and a strong sense of purpose.

This repository is where I showcase my projects, technical growth, and passion for all things data.

## ðŸ“‚ Portfolio Projects

### Customer Segmentation â€“ FiftyEight Ltd (Industrial Placement)

**Goal:**  
To segment 75,000+ users of the Just Good Work app based on behavioural and demographic patterns to support ethical hiring strategies, regional marketing, and stakeholder decision-making.

**Code:** [`Customer_Segmentation_FiftyEight.ipynb`](https://github.com/yourusername/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Customer_Segmentation_FiftyEight.ipynb)

**Description:**  
The dataset included user records from the Just Good Work app, supplemented by UK Home Office visa data. The project involved EDA, handling missing values, feature engineering, outlier detection, and dimensionality reduction using PCA. Three unsupervised machine learning models were implemented (K-Means, K-Modes, DBSCAN) to identify clusters of user profiles.

**Skills:**  
EDA, customer segmentation, dimensionality reduction, outlier detection, clustering, data visualization, stakeholder communication.

**Technology:**  
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Power BI, SQL.

**Results:**  
Developed and presented an interactive Power BI dashboard showing 4 key user segments. Insights were used to tailor regional outreach strategies and improve app engagement among high-risk worker groups.

### Accident Severity Prediction â€“ MSc Academic Project

**Goal:**  
To build a machine learning model that predicts traffic accident severity levels based on road and driver-related features.

**Code:** [`Accident_Severity_Prediction.ipynb`](https://github.com/yourusername/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Accident_Severity_Prediction.ipynb)

**Description:**  
Used a dataset with over 32,000 UK accident records. The project included EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering, class imbalance handling, and multi-model ML training. Three classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) were trained, with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

**Skills:**  
Predictive modeling, classification, class imbalance handling (SMOTE, oversampling), model tuning, EDA, evaluation metrics.

**Technology:**  
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SMOTE, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

**Results:**  
Achieved an F1-score of 85% on minority class using tuned XGBoost model. Key insights identified road conditions and vehicle type as strong predictors of severity.
